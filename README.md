# PHP

## Welcome

To my glorious and wonderous PHP sandbox! Working with PHP was pleasant. For me, PHP at the foundation is pretty simplistic. Like in the 
[Array](https://github.com/aquaman48/PHP/blob/main/Sandbox/Array.php) example I did. What is interesting as well is with arrays in PHP theres the use of parentheses() instead of square brackets[]. It does seem that really PHP is more of what I would consider as a "support" language. What I mean by that is we can use PHP and inject it into our HTML to expand the capabilities of a website. Very interesting concepts and "good-to-know" knowledge.
